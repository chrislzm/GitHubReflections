What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- Git creates a .git directory in the directory you created the repository which contains all of the meta data for the repository. You need to do this so that git knows there's a repository and so it can manage it correctly.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- The staging area is a holding place for files you want to commit but haven't been committed to the repository yet. The working directory is the current directory of files of which you don't necissarily want to commit all of them. This is good because you may have some huge video files in the directory you don't need to commit, or files that will never change, or unrelated files, etc. This gives you more control.
